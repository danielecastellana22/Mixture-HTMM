# Mixtures of SP-BHTMM
This repository contains the code used to validate the work presented in the journal paper "[Bayesian Mixtures of Hidden Tree Markov Models forStructured Data Clustering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231219301444)" by Davide Bacciu and Daniele Castellana. 
The paper deals with the problem of unsupervised learning with structured data, proposing a mixture model approach to cluster tree samples. In particular, the paper define two model:
- a Mixture of Switching Parent Bottom-up Hidden Tree Markov Model (MIX-SP-BHTMM)
- a non parametric extension of the MIX-SP-BHTMM (INF-SP-BHTMM)

Both of them relies on the SP-BHTMM, introduced in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6353263/).
