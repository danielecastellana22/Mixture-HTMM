# Mixtures of SP-BHTMM
This repository contains the code used to validate the work presented in the journal paper "Bayesian Mixtures of Hidden Tree Markov Models forStructured Data Clustering" by Davide Bacciu and Daniele Castellana. 
The paper deals with the problem of unsupervised learning with structured data, proposing a mixture model approach to cluster tree samples. In particular, the paper define two model:
- a Mixture of Switching Parent Bottom-up Hidden Tree Markov Model (MIX-SP-BHTMM)
- a non parametric extension of the MIX-SP-BHTMM (INF-SP-BHTMM)

Both of them relies on the SP-BHTMM, introduced in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6353263/).
